# Cura_Position_After_Layer_Script
This is a Cura script built referencing the native time-lapse script... The issue with this script is that it only allows for a Z-hop, and not a dedicated z location (allowing for a dedicated z location allows for us to place a camera switch on the top of the printer instead of mounted on the side).
